    <h1>Matthew's Interview with Jeremiah Tatum</h1>
    <p1>Hello! My name is Matthew Wilson! A student at Base Camp Coding Academy,
        a non-profit that trains high school graduates to be full-stack developers.
        I interveiwed my fellow classmate, Jeremiah Tatum on November 19, 2020.
        Here is how it went.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Matthew: What was the hardest week at Base Camp for you so far?</p1>
    <div></div>
    <p2>Tatum: The loop week, like the 3rd week of the 1st unit. I was completely lost.</p2>
    <div></div>
    <p1>Matthew: What was the easiest week at Base Camp for you so far?</p1>
    <div></div>
    <p2>Tatum: This week, on HTML. I guess because it's more hands on, rather than looking at the book.</p2>
    <div></div>
    <p1>Matthew: What has been your greatest victory while studying at Base Camp?</p1>
    <div></div>
    <p2>Tatum: Surviving each unit project. In the first unit, I was not the strongest. 
        The first unit was a struggle. I got in contact with a former student, Tyler Irving. 
        He walked me through the course work.</p2>
    <div></div>
    <p1>Matthew: What was your favorite thing to study here at Base Camp?</p1>
    <div></div>
    <p2>Tatum: Before Base Camp, I was mainly into the hardware of computers, but I am
        liking HTML and CSS a lot.
