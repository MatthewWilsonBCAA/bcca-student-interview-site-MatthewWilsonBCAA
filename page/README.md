# Build and Host your First Site on GitHub Pages

In this assignment you are going to build and deploy your first website, but just like
[Web Design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/) says you need to
get some content first.

## What Is This Website About

You are going to interview your tablemate to find out more about their experience at BCCA.
You should at least ask them the following questions:

- What has been the toughest week at BCCA?
- What has been the easiest week at BCCA?
- What is your biggest victory so far at BCCA?

Once you have this information, you are going to create a website to share this interview
with the internet! Your website should include:

- Who you are
- Who you interviewed
- What questions you asked
- What responses you receieved
- When did the interview happen
- Any useful context about BCCA

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

You can go into Settings >> Github Pages and tell GitHub to host your the contents of your main branch.

This will host your website at `https://username.github.io/repository`. Considering that this assignment
repository is owned by BaseCampCoding, you should fork the repository so that you can host it under your
own username.
